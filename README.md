# Office Stoplight

## Project Decription

I work from home, and my workspace also happens to directly attatch to the garage. Because of this, my family often needs access to the garage, but does not know if I can be disturbed. This system will give them a definitive answer, by placing adjustable LEDs on the outside of the office and garage doors.

Please feel free to use everything here to build your own.
