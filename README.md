# Office Stoplight

## Inspiration

I work from home, and my workspace also happens to directly attatch to the garage. Because of this, my family often needs access to the garage, but does not know if I can be disturbed. This system will give them a definitive answer, by placing adjustable LEDs on the outside of the office and garage doors. 

## Use

- **RED:** DO NOT DISTURB
- **YELLOW:** You can come in, but be quiet.
- **GREEN:** Come on in!

## Progress:

- Code is written
- Device circuitry is tested
