# Office Stoplight

## Project Decription

I work from home, and my workspace also happens to directly attatch to the garage. Because of this, my family often needs access to the garage, but does not know if I can be disturbed. This system will give them a definitive answer, by placing adjustable LEDs on the outside of the office and garage doors.

Please feel free to use everything here to build your own.

## Hardware

### Pre-requisites:

1. You will need to set up a Raspberry Pi. **[Click Here for Instructions](https://github.com/DavidMiles1925/pi_zero_setup)**

### Circuit Diagram

This diagram represents the circuit for the "desK" unit. For the "door" unit, simply omit the buttons.

## Running the Code

**1. Clone the Repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavidMiles1925/office_stoplight.git
```

**2. Navigate to Program Directory**

```bash
cd office_stoplight.git
```

**3. Test the program**

```bash
sudo python stoplight.py
```

**4. Set to Run on Startup**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

**Add this to the file `rc.local`. _DO NOT FORGET THE "&"_**

```bash
sudo python /your_pi_name/office_stoplight/stoplight.py &
```

## What the Lights Mean

- **RED:** DO NOT DISTURB
- **YELLOW:** You can come in, but be quiet.
- **GREEN:** Come on in!
